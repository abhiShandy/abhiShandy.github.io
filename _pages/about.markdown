# About me

I'm a Material Science Ph.D. student at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)](https://mse.rpi.edu). My doctoral research is on modeling interfaces in polymer nanodielectrics. I use electronic structure methods and classical molecular dynamics to characterize dielectric and mechanical properties of these interfaces. If you can help me understand this topic, let me know.

I am a big fan of Bitcoin and Tesla. I love playing basketball, weight-lifting and running. I listen to Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Halsey, Rekha Bharadwaj and A R Rahman (check them out on Spotify/YouTube if you haven't).

I started this blog to document my thoughts, share my ever-growing but limited knowledge about how things work and what is happening around. I hope this blog will help me improve my writing skills, structure my thought process and show my real version to the world.

This website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme. It is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) and there are no trackers installed.
