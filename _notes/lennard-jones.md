It is the simplest and widely adopted interaction potential used in modeling particles. It has two terms: repulsive and attractive.

\\[E=\epsilon\left[\left(\frac{r_{min}}{r}\right)^{12} - 2\left(\frac{r_{min}}{r}\right)^6\right]\\]
\\[E=4\epsilon\left[\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12} - \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^6\right]\\]

where
\\[r_{min} = 2^{1/12}\sigma\\]
