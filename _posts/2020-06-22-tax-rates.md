title: Tax Rates in US
---

In US, like many countries, income is taxed progressively at increasing rates. The tax rates can vary from 10% to 37% based on the income slabs. Since the income is divided into chunks and taxed at different rates, the effective tax rate is always lower than the highest applied tax rate. In the figure shown below, I have calculated the effective income tax rate on income upto one million dollars (illustrated using red curves).

Interestingly, the long-term capital gains tax rates are lower than the income tax, and the resultant effective tax is also lower (as illustrated by blue curves in the figure). This means that re-routing salaries as capital gains can save between 10 to 15% taxes. Probably, high-net worth individuals (HNWI) already know this.
