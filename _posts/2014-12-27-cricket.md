title: Watching cricket in India
date: December 27, 2014

It was Day 2 of the 3rd test between Australia and India (I'm mentioning Australia first because they are the host). While watching tests I received few mails, reminders and mused calls too to make me realise that even though it's a Saturday I can use time to do something constructive. However I chose staring at the TV screen and waste my time.

Indians (particularly Indian gents) love watching cricket and hates to do anything else during the play. They also hate anyone who try to disturb them or even remind them of any important work.

My question is, "Is watching cricket the biggest reason behind reduced work-efficiency of Indians?"
