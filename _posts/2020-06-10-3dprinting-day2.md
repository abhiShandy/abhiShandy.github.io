title: 3D printing - Day 2
---

# Vase
I chose the low quality 0.28 mm layer height, no infill density and also removed the top layers to print 120mm tall vase. I think I can further increase the layer height to degrade to the Z-resolution and reduce print time.

# Testing the extremes of build volume
This will test the promised build volume, any wire-tangling, vibrations of vertical screwguide and other unseen scenarios. This will also be take the longest time to print which can test the appropriate time of the day to print in a shared apartment like mine.

- Stepper motion is limited to 235 x 235 x 250 mm 
- Specified build volume is 220 x 220 x 250 mm

# Rocket

# Interuppting print

Pausing the print creates strings and small artifacts in the model. It should be avoided.

# First anomaly
# Using the glass bed
# Batarang with concentric pattern
