title: Replacement for voting system
date: December 27, 2014

Recently I witnessed a situation where one of the two candidates had to be selected by voting and to my surprise one of them withdrew to make the other the unanimous winner.

I consider the withdrawing candidate a coward as I think (for now) that election is healthy and mature adults must face it. However, there were very few others among the attendees who second my thought. Everyone else was relieved to find a unanimous winner.

What do you think?
