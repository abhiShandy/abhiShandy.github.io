# Common polymers

- PE
	- if ethylene is monomer: (C2H4)n  MW = 28
	- if methylene is monomer: (CH2)n  MW = 14

- PP
	- it's like PE with a CH3 on each monomer: (C3H6)n MW = 42

- PMMA
	- it's like PE with a benzene ring on each monomer: (C8H8)n MW = 104

# Molecular weight

This quantity is used to measure the size of polymers. It is calculated by weighted-average of MW of all chains. The chains are binned by their molecular weights, but the height of their bins is measured either by number fraction or weight fraction.

Number-average MW uses number fraction
<p>\[\bar{M}_n = \sum x_i M_i\]</p>

Weight-average MW uses weight fraction
<p>\[\bar{M}_w = \sum w_i M_i\]</p>

An alternative way to denote chain size is the degree of polymerization, which is basically number-average MW divided by the weight of one monomer.
<p>\[DP=\frac{\bar{M}_n}{m}\]</p>

Questions:
1. Do these formulae work for co-polymers?

# Entanglement
A chain is said to be entangled when it passes an arbitrary plain at three points or more. The chain should be long and flexible enough to get entangled. Polymers with low entanglement lengths are generally tough.

Critical MW for entanglement of common polymers:

| polymer | MW |
| -- | -- |
| PE | 4000 | 
| PP | 7000 | 
| PMMA | 18,000 | 
| PS | 32,000 | 
| PC | 4500 |
