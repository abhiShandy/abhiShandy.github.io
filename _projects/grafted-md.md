title: Mechanical strength of grafted polymer chains

Understanding the role of interfaces in mechanical response of nanocomposites is crucial for their robust design. Modelling them at the molecular scale can capture the nanoscale features of the filler surface, the amorphous nature of the polymer and the interaction between them, while keeping the computational cost managable. Using molecular dynamics, we calculate mechanical response of an ensemble of composites where polymer chains are grafted on a filler surface. We study the role of graft density and filler surface curvature on the stress and displacement field near the interface.
