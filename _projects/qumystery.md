Using IBM [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) and [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), Adela and I developed a web-app to teach some basic elements of an hot field, <i>quantum computing</i>. This project was brain-stormed and developed during a 24-hour long hackathon at my university (HackRPI) and delightfully, we won the <b>Best RPI Hack</b> award.
