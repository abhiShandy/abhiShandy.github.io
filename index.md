## About me
I'm currently pursuing PhD in Materials Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
In 2017, I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology Madras with Bachelors and Masters in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering.
I spent my childhood in Jamshedpur where I attended DBMS English School for 14 years.
Physics, mathematics and computer science always have been my favorite topics. My masters and doctoral thesis in computational materials science are extensions of that interest. My life goal is to develop software tools for scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs to extend the knowledge sphere of science and technology.

## Skills

Most of my skills fall in the computer category. I am an avid programmer with specialization in scientific computing. I can also design web-pages and build website backends. You can find detailed list on my [CV](/cv). In the physical space, I love tinkering and building robots. Throughout my high school and undergrad, I have built numerous robots ranging from a basic motorized boat to a complicated semi-autonomous 4-wheeled robots.

## Hobbies

I am fond of still photography and cinematography. To capture landscapes and nature, I like traveling to different parts of the country in all four seasons. Apart from that, I like reading books and watching movies on science fiction, decision theory, investing and economics. I have special interest in Bitcoin which has taught me the importance of saving and securing my personal wealth.
