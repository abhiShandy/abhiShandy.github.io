title: What's limited other than your time? Bitcoin!
---

Unless we discover the immortality potion, all of us have an unknown but certain expiry date. In other words, our time is most the valuable resource. We should spend it wisely, ration it for the most important tasks and share it with people we care about. What`s the next  valuable respource? It`s Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is limited. It can`t be changed. It can be forked. It`s a long pending upgrade for the financial system. It removes intermediaries, encourages personal responsibility, borderless, truly global currency, settles faster than existing banking system, 24x7 online, verifiable with a cheap computer, not as convenient to use, has a learning curve (because it`s new and revolutionary).
