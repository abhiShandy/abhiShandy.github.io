## Modelling and Simulation
### 1. Master's Thesis
### 2. TRDDC

### 3. Scaffold
I applied finite element method (FEM) to analyse the scaffolds manufactured using selected laser melting (SLM). I used ABAQUS for creating the 3D model of scaffolds, and applying compressive and tensile loads to find the weak points.

## Web Development
### 1. Shaastra and Saarang

### 2. AdWyze
In winter 2014, I interned as front-end web-developer at AdWyze. They are developing a product for analysing and improving online ads for various companies. I made a lot of simple but necessary UI/UX changes as no one in the founding team could spend time on front-end. Firstly, I migrated from Bootstrap 2 to Bootstrap 3. Then I used elements of Bootstrap alongwith DataTables and jQuery to improve UI/UX of the dashboard. All these changes had to be done in the Ruby-on-Rails framework, which was new for me. As instructed after the selection, I had come prepared by reading the famous book authored by Michael Hartl. I received a performance bonus and verbatim job offer.

### 3. HEA
I developed a static website for the High Entropy Alloys research group in India. [Check it out](https://mme.iitm.ac.in/hea/)! It was a freelance project from the Nano Technology Lab of my department.

### 4. SolarDC and UDC

## Robotics
### 1. Robocon
### 2. Gold Rush
